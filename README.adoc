= CDI Cluster Scope based on Infinispan

All credits to *Romain Manni-Bucau* Hazelcast https://github.com/rmannibucau/cluster-scope[cluster scope version].
 

I've created this version due to classloading issues with Hazelcast and jboss modules.

Tested with Jboss EAP 6.x and Wildfly 8.0.0

IMPORTANT: you need to enable infinispan module in WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml
[source,xml]
----
<jboss-deployment-structure>
	<deployment>
		<dependencies>
			<module name="org.infinispan" export="true" />
		</dependencies>
	</deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
----


To see it in action start jboss/wildfly in domain mode and deploy the application on multiple nodes, the Clustered bean should
be instantiated only the first time and must share its state between cluster nodes.
