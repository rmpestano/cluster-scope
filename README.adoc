= CDI Cluster Scope based on Infinispan

All credits to *Romain Manni-Bucau* Hazelcast https://github.com/rmannibucau/cluster-scope[cluster scope version].
 

I've created this version due to classloading issues with Hazelcast and jboss modules.

Tested with Jboss EAP 6.x and Wildfly 8.0.0

To see it in action start jboss/wildfly in domain mode and deploy the application on multiple nodes, the Clustered bean should
be instantiated only the first time and must share its state between cluster nodes.

I've made a video you can watch here:http://youtu.be/4vYx6xcELeo
